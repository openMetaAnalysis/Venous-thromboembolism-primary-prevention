Venous thromboembolism prevention in the hospital
============================================
A living systematic review

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that clinical intervention *is not* effective unless presented the the physician in a modal dialogue box (eg, forcing function) within the electronic health record. Heterogeneity of results as measured by I<sup>2</sup> was '[substantial](http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm)' at 98%. This review updates previously published meta-analysis(es).(citation[s] below)

Meta-regression of common modulators (year of publication, study size, event rate in the control groups) finds that the outcome of the intervention is effected by xx.
